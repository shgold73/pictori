Welcome to Pictory (Picture + Story)!
Pictory is a fun new webapp that allows users to sign up, post, tag their own photos as well as view and comment on other 
users's posts.

Ravi worked on the various functionalities of the webapp such as creating new imageposts, posting comments and adding tags, 
user sign-up, log-in pages and made some css contributions;

Kathy worked on the css of the entire look and feel of the webapp, including the logo, and bug hunting;

Shoshanna worked on the initial setup of the express app and created the database.

Some of the packages used to create this webapp were sequelize/sequelize-cli, sharp and amazon aws-sdk.

The most challenging part of this project was learning capabiltiies not covered in class, such as tagging. There were
also npm/package installtion issues.

Some features that would have been nice to add to the app are: functionality to allow users to follow and see each others' 
pages, add photo filters prior to posting or via edit image feature, like (although the heart is there we weren't able to 
hook it up) and add "forgot password" capability for users to reset their password.
